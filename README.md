# Auto Document Scanner

A Python Jupyter Notebook project for **automatic document detection and scanning**, using OpenCV and image processing techniques. This tool turns photos of papers, receipts, and documents into clear, top-down scanned images by automatically detecting edges and applying a perspective transformation.

---

## 🚀 Description

This project is designed to **detect**, **extract**, and **enhance** documents from regular photos, using robust computer vision methods. You get step-by-step processing with visual outputs, ideal for learning, experimentation, or quick scanning needs.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Automatic edge and contour detection** for document localization
- **Perspective transformation** for “flattening” the document
- **Image enhancement** for improved readability
- **Modular, well-documented code** for easy extension
- **Stepwise cell structure** in Jupyter Notebook, with visual outputs

---

## 🖥️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib notebook
```
