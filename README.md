# Document Scanner

A Python Jupyter Notebook project for **automatic document detection and scanning**, using OpenCV and image processing techniques. This tool turns photos of papers, receipts, and documents into clear, top-down scanned images by automatically detecting edges and applying a perspective transformation.

---

## üöÄ Description

This project is designed to **detect**, **extract**, and **enhance** documents from regular photos, using robust computer vision methods. You get step-by-step processing with visual outputs, ideal for learning, experimentation, or quick scanning needs.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic edge and contour detection** for document localization
- **Perspective transformation** for ‚Äúflattening‚Äù the document
- **Image enhancement** for improved readability
- **Modular, well-documented code** for easy extension
- **Stepwise cell structure** in Jupyter Notebook, with visual outputs
